### Potential Features
- Card Ownership
    - [ ] Add 'Collection' tab to side menu
        - [ ] Use GraphQL service to populate users' collections
    - [ ] Pokemon stored on IPFS with:
        - JPG scan of the base card
            - the scan for every base card will already be in ipfs
            - just need to reference its particular hash
        - JSON details of the card's:
            - name and nickname
            - moves 
            - current level
                - will be at base level if newly minted
                - no need to track experience, cards are only minted if new level obtained
            - IVs and EVs
    - [ ] ERC 1155 Smart Contract for storing ownership of IPFS hashes
- Card Minting
    - Mint new cards using:
        - [ ] jpg scan of base card (should already be on IPFS)
        - [ ] json metadata with the following:
    ```
    {
        'name': 'pokemonString',
        'nickname': 'userDefinedString',
        'moves': ['move1', 'move2'],
        'level': 0,
        'IVs': [6,15,3,15,0],
        'EVs': [0,0,0,0,0]
    }
    ```
    - Opening new packs of cards 
    - Cards evolving through level or stones
- Card Burning
    - combining card to raise IVs
- Technical Machines and Hidden Machines
    - ToDo
    - Some TMs/HMs may need to be pokemon powers instead of moves
    - Some TMs/HMs may need to be used for balancing vs some for rare/valuable rewards
    - interesting features to consider incorporating:
        - incorporate 'Opportunity Cost' considerations
            - discarding specific cards (trainers, energy, specific pokemon evolution stages, etc.) for specific effects/bonuses
        - power/move allowing player to swar card in hand for prize card 
        - more ways to mill cards
        - incorporate STAB bonuses for typed moves
            - more damage vs reduced energy costs
        - incorporate evolution staging dependency for damage and energy costs
            - higher evolutions should do more damage for less
            - cards with no evolution should maybe be considered as a partial evolution (0.5 or 1.5 )
        - reduce damage for moves naturally learned by some cards vs has to be taught to be learned
        - energy manipulation moves/powers
            - to counter/balance energy removals
        - powers that interact with trainer cards
            - or specific trainers to boost under-powered ones
            - 'the next (or first?) trainer you play is not discarded (or is played twice)'
    - determine which TMs are already existing moves, and create baselines from those
    - allow attack damage to be divisible by 5 instead of only 10
        - since all old HP values are all divisible by 10
    - incorporate
- Pokemon card training
    - Leveling
        - [ ] Add levels to pokemon Card classes
            - see bottom of base set card for starting level

        - [ ] store experience in centralized repositiory
            - upon each level-up, user's card will be re-minted and stored decentrally 
            - this will also update the card's EV updates
            - user will have option to skip re-baselining level and EV-updates
        - card stat increases not realized until 
    - IVs
        - [ ] Determine which IVs should exist and what they should affect
            - HP - HP

            - Spd - retreat costs
            - Spec. - energy costs
        - [ ] Determine IV thresholds for affecting card stats
            -   HP, damage, and resistence adjustments should allow increments of 2 or 5
                - ex: HP of 76, or resistence of -14
                - ex: HP of 95, or move damage of 15
        - [ ] Create card scan overlays to indicate IV affects 
        - [ ] Update JSON minting tool to modify IVs
    - EVs
